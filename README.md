**MRT-3 Ridership Prediction using Regression Models**


**Overview:**

This project predicts daily ridership on Metro Manila’s MRT-3 2022-mid 2025 line using machine learning regression techniques. It compares the performance of Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression to identify which model best captures ridership patterns based on station and time features.

**Objectives:**
- Clean and preprocess MRT-3 ridership data (2022–mid 2025).
- Explore and visualize key trends and correlations.
- Build and evaluate regression models for ridership prediction.
- Determine the best-performing model based on accuracy and error metrics.

**Dataset:**

Column	     Description
Date	       Trip date
Origin	     Departure station
Destination	 Arrival station
Passenger    Count	Number of passengers
Revenue	     Total revenue (renamed from “Sales”)

**Methodology:**
1. Preprocessing – Cleaned data, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features.
2. EDA – Visualized distributions, correlations, and trends across stations.
3. Modeling – Trained Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression using scikit-learn.
4. Evaluation – Compared models using MAE, RMSE, and R² scores.

**Tech Stack and Libraries:**
- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy – Data processing
- Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualization
- Scikit-learn – Machine learning
- Statsmodels – Model diagnostics
- Google Colab – Environment
