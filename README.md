# MRT-3-Regression-Project
This is a regression machine learning prediction project from the MRT-3 dataset. It compares Linear and Random Forest Regression where the project compares what model best fits the dataset. It then predicts the months with the highest and lowest ridership based on Origin-Destination pairs and the prediction of revenue based on the predicted trips.
